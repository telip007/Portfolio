# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Talip 👋 Currently studying computer science in 🇩🇪 and part-time iOS Developer. For long time I felt like I need a portfolio to showcase the projects I worked on but felt too lazy to get started. Now with [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) being open sourced I wanted to try it out and thought that building a small portfolio with it would be a nice way to experiment with it.

## Work in progress

The site is far from done. I barely started setting up basic Vapor stuff and a simple example from Bootstrap. I hope to finish the site in the coming months.

## Credits

Huge shout to [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) who developed [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) for his [blog](https://swiftbysundell.com) and open sourced it. Also a big thank you to [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor), which makes it super easy to write server side code in swift for people like me who just love swift and would like to use it everywhere they can 😄.
